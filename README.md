# Project 6 - Restaurant Review App

## Project Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage is converted to an accessible and responsive web page. It should also contain a service worker to enable an offline experience for your users who should be able to acces the previously visited content. The original repository created by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) already provided an initial code for the restaurant reviews.

Te original repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I haven't added any additionel external ressources, libraries or frameworks.

### Learning Objectives

* To apply the principles of responsive design
* To practice accessibility rules
* To implement a service worker

## Project Access

* Download the repository as zip file or clone the repository.
* The project runs on the local server port 8000. You can either use the extension "Web Server" for Chrome to run a server simulation and set the port to 8000. 
* Or you can open your terminal, check the python version with python -V. 
 ** If you are using Python 2.x, type python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000.
 ** If you are using Python 3.x, type python3 -m http.server 8000.
 ** You may need to install Python, if neccessary. However, for Windows systems, Python 3.x shoud be already installed as 'python' by default, so you can just enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
* Type in the browser URL field: localhost:8000.
